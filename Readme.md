This repository contains my solutions for the Advent of Code 2023 challenges. Advent of Code is an annual event featuring daily programming puzzles from December 1st to December 25th.


## Introduction

Advent of Code is a great opportunity to challenge and improve your coding skills. This repository is a collection of my solutions for the challenges provided in the Advent of Code 2023 event. Each day's challenge is stored in its respective directory, and the solutions are implemented in Python.

## Solutions

- [Day 1](./Day%201)
- [Day 2](./Day%202)
- ...

Each day's directory contains the problem description (`README.md`) and the corresponding Python script in two parts(`Part 1.py` and `Part 2.py`). Feel free to explore the solutions and provide feedback!

## Usage

To run a specific day's solution, navigate to the corresponding directory and execute the Python script.

```bash
cd "Day 1"
py "Part 1.py"
